Proteins are essential to all biological functions and its structure provides a mechanistic understanding of the function. Previous techniques, such as cryo-electron microscopy, require extensive time and equipment to determine single protein structures. So far, the structure of 100,000 proteins have been determined but this only represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences. Additionally, previous techniques are not always atomically accurate, especially when no homologous proteins have been determined. AlphaFold, a machine learning approach, addresses these problems by predicting protein structures with high accuracy and greater efficiency.
